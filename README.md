# BLOXXIA Studio Launcher
## Launcher Guide
The BloxxiaStudio Launcher is the executable you should run when launching BloxxiaStudio, and is also the executable you should make a shortcut to on your PC and Taskbar.
The reason for this is due to it handling the updates for BloxxiaStudio and using the direct BloxxiaStudioBeta.exe file from your installation will never update and you will miss out on
many updates, patches and security features.
