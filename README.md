# KORNET Launcher
## Launcher Guide
The KornetStudio Launcher is the executable you should run when launching KornetStudio, and is also the executable you should make a shortcut to on your PC and Taskbar.
The reason for this is due to it handling the updates for KornetStudio and using the direct KornetStudioBeta.exe file from your installation will never update and you will miss out on
many updates, patches and security features.

## Download
Download it from the releases. You can find older releases of KornetStudio binaries in the archive repository.
